<h1>How do I watch over an ad?</h1>
<p>To watch over an ad, we suggest that you add it to your Watchlist. The Watchlist allows you to book mark ads you are interested on dubizzle. When you add an item to your watchlist, a link to that ad will remain in your watchlist until the ad expires or is removed.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Here's how to add an ad on&nbsp;your Watchlist:</strong></p>
<p>To add an item on your Watchlist, just click on "Watch this" button that can be found on each and every ad.</p>

<p>A notification will prompt you to confirm that it was added on your watchlist.</p>
