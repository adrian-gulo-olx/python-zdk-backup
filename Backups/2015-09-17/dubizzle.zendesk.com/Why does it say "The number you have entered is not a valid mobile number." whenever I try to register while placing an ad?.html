<p>We regret to inform you that at the moment, the full service is only available to UAE users with local numbers that are able to receive / send the SMS locally. <br /><br />However, you may still register in the site without a mobile number needed through this link (But you wont be able to place an ad): <a href="http://dubai.dubizzle.com/accounts/register/">http://dubai.dubizzle.com/accounts/register/</a></p>
