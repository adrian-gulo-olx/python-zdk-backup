<h1>Can I pay using your service?</h1>

<p>Pay attention! You are responsible for the actions taken by you.</p>
<p><strong>Remember!</strong> Never send money to seller account, do not hand over money or dispatch fee for an item. If the seller insists you that he will send item only after you posted the payment on his account - unsubscribe from this ad and look at the other sellers.</p>
