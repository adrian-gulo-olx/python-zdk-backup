<h1>Where can I find my ad?</h1>
<p>Once your ad is live, you will get a notification email stating that your ad is live on OLX.</p>
<p>In the case your ad is rejected, it may have violated our <a href="http://olx.in/terms/" target="_blank">posting rules.</a> You will also get an email giving a reason for the rejection with a link to edit your ad.</p>
<p>You can keep track of your ads by <a href="https://ssl.olx.in/account/?ref%5B0%5D%5Baction%5D=myaccount&amp;ref%5B0%5D%5Bmethod%5D=index" target="_blank">logging in</a> to your OLX account and clicking on My ads. Here you will see the status of your ads i.e pending, approved or rejected, with options to edit and delete them.</p>
