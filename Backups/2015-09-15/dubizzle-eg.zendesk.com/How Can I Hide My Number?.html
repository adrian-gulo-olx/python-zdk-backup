<h1>How Can I Hide My Number?</h1>
<p>To hide your contact number, please uncheck the phone number box while placing your ad and you can communicate with buyers via email.</p>
<p>This is not advisable however, because showing your number increases your chances of selling and adds credibility to the AD.<br />Note: If posting AD in Cars Category, Phone number must be shown not hidden otherwise ad will be rejected.</p>
