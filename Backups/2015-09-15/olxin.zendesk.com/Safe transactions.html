<h1>Safe transactions</h1>
<p><a href="/hc/admin/articles/204181531-Safe-transactions/olx.in">OLX</a> local ads is a service, where we recommend a personal collection of the item! Meet the seller, see what you want to buy and then pay.</p>
<p>Don't you want to take advantage of the possibility of directly receiving the item? Remember that you do so at your own risk - <a href="/hc/admin/articles/204181531-Safe-transactions/olx.in">OLX</a> does not offer you any security.</p>
<p>While trading locally, use your common sense and have limited trust.</p>
<p>You can also read our tips:</p>
<p><strong>Payment</strong></p>
<p>Always meet the seller in person and transfer cash only when you are sure that the product is in conformity with the description placed in the announcement. Never transfer money in advance and do not pay by account! <br />If you are unable to meet the seller personally, ask for a shipment and check the contents of the courier during delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Place</strong></p>
<p>Always meet in a public place (such as a shopping mall or main center). We do not know the person you are meeting, so be careful.</p>
<p><strong>Subject</strong></p>
<p>The meeting allows accurate verification of item being purchased - so use this opportunity. Make sure the item is consistent with the description in the ad.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>Share only the necessary information. Just make an appointment and do not give anyone your name, address and other information that you do not need to arrange a meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Contact</strong></p>
<p>We recommend correspondence to the user through <a href="/hc/admin/articles/204181531-Safe-transactions/olx.in">OLX.in</a>. Do not write to them using private e-mails.</p>
