<h1>Why is my app displaying old ads?</h1>
<p>There are two reasons why your app is displaying old ads. First, you might not have internet connection and thus your ads are not being refreshed. Second, you might be using an old app version (versions lower than 4.0).</p>
<p>For Android users, you can check your app version by tapping the Left Drawer Menu and going to About app. Your app version is displayed below the OLX logo.</p>
<p>For iOS users, you can check your app version by scrolling down your page to the bottom most part of the Homepage, after the Category display. If this is not what your app looks like your app most likely is not updated as well.</p>
<p>We highly suggest you update your app to get new ads. You can download our app for free for both <a href="http://olx.ph/android">Android</a> and <a href="http://olx.ph/ios">iOS</a>.</p>
