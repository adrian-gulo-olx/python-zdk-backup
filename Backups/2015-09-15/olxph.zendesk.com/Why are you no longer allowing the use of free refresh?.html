<h1>Why are you no longer allowing the use of free refresh?</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the refresh feature now coming with a minimal fee, we aim to regulate the use of this feature to ensure that only available items are seen on our search results. This will provide buyers a better browsing experience and the sellers with more quality inquiries. As a bonus, misleading ads will be minimized.</span></p>
<p>We have noticed several cases of misuse by users who take the free refresh as an opportunity to bump up their ads and lure in potential scam victims. In order to avoid these cases that result in legitimate ads going unnoticed, we are no longer allowing potential scammers from misusing the free feature.</p>
