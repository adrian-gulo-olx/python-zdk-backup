<h1>Phishing Attempt: Is This Email I Received From Dubizzle?</h1>
<p>If you have posted an ad on dubizzle we will send you a small number of emails to keep you updated on the status of your ad.  Sometimes you may receive an email that looks like it is from dubizzle but you aren't sure.<br /> <br /> Spoof / Phishing emails are fake emails made to look like they’ve been sent by a legitimate company. They trick people into either replying or clicking a link to reveal confidential information like bank account details or account email and passwords.<br /> <br /><strong>How to spot a spoof email</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Urgency required to act on an ad or account status</strong>: Often spoof emails threaten you with removing your ad, account blocking or restrict your website access unless you reconfirm your account details.  <span class="wysiwyg-color-red"><strong>We would never do this!</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sender’s email address</strong>: Email addresses are easily forged, so never assume the address that appears in the ‘From’ line is real.  Just because it says the email is from <a href="mailto:xxx@dubizzle.com">xxx@dubizzle.com</a> or <a href="mailto:dubizzle@outlook.com">dubizzle@outlook.com</a> doesn't mean it really is.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Links to a fake website requesting personal information</strong>: The spoof email usually contains a link to a fake website that looks like the dubizzle site. One way to tell if they’re fake is by looking at the URL (see example below). Legitimate dubizzle pages will always be on <span class="wysiwyg-color-blue"><a href="http://www.dubizzle.com">dubizzle.com</a></span> , <a href="http://dubai.%20dubizzle.com">http://dubai.dubizzle.com</a> or <a href="http://dubai.%20dubizzle.com">dubai.dubizzle.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Fake websites</strong> examples are as follows <span class="wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-color-blue">http://yhj4n5r4wr.6te.net/uae.dubizzle.com/</span><strong><em> , </em></strong><span class="wysiwyg-color-blue"><span class="wysiwyg-underline">http://uae.dubizzle.com.cars.uae-cgi.com/users/reactivate/</span> , </span><span class="wysiwyg-color-blue"><span class="wysiwyg-underline">http://uae-acc.info/dubizzle/accounts/login/</span> </span>Fake websites always ask for sensitive information, such as your credit card details, account name, email address or password to ‘confirm’ or ‘verify’ or ‘reactivate’ your status. Never follow instructions on such sites.</p>
