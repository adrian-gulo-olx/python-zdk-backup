<h1>Can I carry credits forward?</h1>
<p>Unused daily credits are not carried over to the next day, so make sure you use all your credits for refreshes if you no longer need to post new listings.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Example:</strong> you own the 25 listings package, which entitles you to 5 daily credits. On Monday you post 5 new ads, which consume all of your 5 daily credits and you can no longer place new ads or refresh an ad that day. On Tuesday your 5 daily credits are regenerated and you can use them for example to refresh 2 of your ads and place an additional 3 ads. And so on.</p>
