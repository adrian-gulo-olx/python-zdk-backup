<h1>How can I nominate a Primary Contact Number?</h1>
<p><span class="fontsize3 wysiwyg-font-size-medium">You can nominate a Primary Contact number through any of the following:</span></p>
<p>1. If you do not have an existing OLX.ph account and will post an ad for the first time using your mobile number, OLX.ph will create a user account for you and your listed contact number will be your Primary Contact number.</p>
<p>2. If you already have an existing OLX.ph account and wish to nominate a Primary account number, go to your 'Update Profile' page (<a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://www.olx.ph/index.php/update+profile">https://www.olx.ph/index.php/update+profile</a>) by clicking on &lsquo;Edit Profile&rsquo; under your username in the member menu while logged in.<br />You should check your mobile phone for a confirmation SMS coming from OLX.ph (yes, it's a word and not from a 2366 or any 4-digit number). You can either click this link directly from your smartphone or by typing the link in a browser.</p>
<p>3. You can also directly nominate a Primary contact number by registering to our site by using your mobile number.</p>
