<h1>How can I post an ad without logging in?</h1>
<p>You may do so by:</p>
<p>1. Clicking the &lsquo;Sell your item now&rsquo; button from the homepage<br />2. Completely filling out all the required ad details <br />3. By pressing submit, you should be able to see this ad confirmation page </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Enter the code that you received via SMS and input it in the code field and click &lsquo;Confirm Ad&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The code should come in 6 characters</p>
<p>(Sample code)</p>

<p>The SMS should look similar to this:</p>
<p><img src="https://olxph.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201550530/CodeSms.PNG" alt="" /></p>
<p>If the code that you input is correct, your ad will be submitted and will be up in our search results after a few minutes.</p>
<p><br />You will also be automatically logged in to our system and will have full access of OLX.ph just like when you login traditionally</p>
<p><br />Should you wish to post an ad again while logged in, just click the &lsquo;Sell Your Item Now&rsquo; button and submit an ad as usual. No need to wait for a confirmation code since you&rsquo;re already logged in. </p>
