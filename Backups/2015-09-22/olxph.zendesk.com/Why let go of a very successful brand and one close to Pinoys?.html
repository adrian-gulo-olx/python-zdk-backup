<h1>Why let go of a very successful brand and one close to Pinoys?</h1>
<p>We understand how Sulit has become a part of our daily lives and that's exactly our inspiration to continue improving our product and services.</p>
<p>The brand change is a representation of our commitment to change how Filipinos perceive online selling. To reinforce the great feeling of being able to get value from items that are just gathering dust in your home. This is a start of a selling movement to get the next 1 million Filipino sellers to sell their unused 2nd hand items on OLX.ph.</p>
