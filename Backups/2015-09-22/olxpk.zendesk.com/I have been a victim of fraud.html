<h1>I have been a victim of fraud</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At OLX, we provide an online platform where users can advertise and search a vast variety of goods and services but we do not provide shipping and payment services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buyer and seller interactions and negotiations are the responsibility of the parties involved.  It is the responsibility of the seller and the buyer to determine how and where the item will be exchanged. The payment method is also up to the seller and buyer to negotiate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do recommend that you sell to a local buyer so that you can meet the individual in person. We also recommend choosing a safe place for exchanging your item.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The safety and security of our users is our top priority so please take a look at our <a href="http://olx.in/safetytips/" target="_blank">Safety Tips</a></span></p>
