<h1>Do I need to register to use OLX?</h1>
<p>You can post, search for ads and navigate the site without&nbsp;being a register user.</p>
<p>To edit your ad, check your conversations to buyers and sellers, and delete your ads, you need to create an account.</p>
<p>Having an account is more powerful and more efficient to make use of OLX!</p>
<p>You can create your account by clicking&nbsp;<a href="http://www.olx.co.ug/register" target="_blank">here</a>. The only info we will request is your email and password.</p>
