<h1>How does the maximum number of live auto listings work?</h1>
<p>Depending on which auto account you subscribe to, you will have a maximum number of live auto listings that you can have published. When you reach the maximum, you will no longer be able to post new listings until you delete an auto listing from My Ads or you sign up for a larger auto package.</p>
