<h1>Troubleshooting Your App</h1>
<p>Here are the basic troubleshooting steps you can do should your app run anything but smoothly. You may try these steps at your discretion.</p>
<ol>
<li>Establish a strong and stable connection</li>
<li>Tests the app using other devices and connections (e.g. other wifi hotspots/mobile data) if possible</li>
<li>Make sure your device has sufficient memory</li>
<li>Close all other running apps to help improve your device's performance</li>
<li>Relaunch the app by closing and opening it again</li>
<li>Clear the app's cache from your device's app manager/settings</li>
<li>Update to the latest version if you haven't done so yet</li>
<li>Reinstall the app</li>
</ol>
<p>Should none of the steps above do the trick, contact our Support Team to report the issue by sending an email to support@olx.ph. Indicate your device's brand/model, OS version, connection, and app version in your email.</p>
