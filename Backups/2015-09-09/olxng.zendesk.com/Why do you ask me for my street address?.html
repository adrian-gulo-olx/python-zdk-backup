<h1>Why do you ask me for my street address?</h1>
<p>When placing an ad you have the option to include your street address. By filling out this field you make it clear to the buyers where the item is located; however, it is not a required field. </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Remember</span> you can only add the street of your address or the city of the State. The number of your house is not mandatory.</p>
