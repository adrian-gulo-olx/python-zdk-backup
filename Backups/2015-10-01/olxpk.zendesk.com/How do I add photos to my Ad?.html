<h1>How do I add photos to my Ad?</h1>
<p>Ads with photos are visited on average 3 to 5 times more, so try to add them! How to do it? It's simple.</p>
<p>Option to add photos can be seen below the ad description field. Photos can be added in 2 ways:</p>
<p><strong>1. The first method</strong> - the fastest and easiest! Click plus and upload a photo from your computer.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="tcenter"><a href="http://olx.in/help/search/?q=photos#full-img-addphotos" rel="facebox"><img class="imgframe" src="http://s2.olx.in/static/olxin/external/olxin/img/helpn/thumb/pic-4.jpg?v=1418896938" alt="" /></a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="tcenter">Swap pictures easily and choose the one that has to be displayed as main in the list. Remember! The size of the added images should not exceed 5 MB.</p>
<p>This mechanism is based on Flash technology. If you see the "Download Flash" - it means that your browser does not have this plug-in. Click on the button to install flash-player and follow the instructions, or download the program from the manufacturer:<a class="external" href="http://get.adobe.com/pl/flashplayer/" target="__blank">http://get.adobe.com/pl/flashplayer/</a> </p>
<p>If, despite the Flash installed and you can't add photos then click on the link "If you're having trouble with flash-player, use the simpler form" and start adding photos by selecting the button "Browse".</p>
<p><strong>2. The second method</strong> - </p>
<p>Directly from your phone! Add photos through a simple click and save option from your smartphone.</p>
<p>Remember! The maximum number of pictures to be added is 8. The maximum size of images is 5 MB and 5000x5000 pixels. Accepted formats are: jpg, jpeg, png.</p>
