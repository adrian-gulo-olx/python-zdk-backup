<h1>How do I get more responses for my ad?</h1>
<div>There are a lot of factors that can affect the sale of an item, here are some pointers you may check to help get more responses for your ad:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>- <strong>Email:</strong> dubizzle responses may be ending up in your junk mail folder, so make sure you check your junk folder.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>- <strong>Phone number:</strong> Make sure that your phone number is showing on your ad (not hidden). Most users prefer to call the advertiser directly. We do not share your contact information with our users, so unless you choose to show your number, they will not be able to contact you by telephone.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>- <strong>Photos: </strong>Make<strong> </strong>your ad more attractive by adding photos to your ad. Make sure you add good,relevant,clear and real photos of the item you are selling.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>-<strong>Description:</strong> Try to type as much information as you can in the item's description. (i.e: size, color, dimensions , where you got it from and why are you selling it.) </div>
<div> </div>
<div>- <strong>Price:</strong> Maybe your price is too high. Compare the price of your ad with other similar ads on the website. If yours is significantly higher we recommend you to try and lower it so you can attract more interested users.</div>
