<h1>What are daily credits and how can I use them?</h1>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">The credits are generated on a daily basis to paid Pro Auto accounts as well as the 5 car package. A credit can be used for:</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">● Placing a new ad</span><br /><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">● Refreshing an existing ad</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Depending on which auto package you have, you will have a maximum number of daily credits. When you&rsquo;ve used all your daily credits, you can no longer post or refresh listings until the next day. The daily credit balance is renewed at the end of the day at 11:59 PM (GMT+4).</span></p>
