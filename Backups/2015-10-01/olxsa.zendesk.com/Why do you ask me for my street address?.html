<h1>Why do you ask me for my street address?</h1>
<p>The street address is not a required field; however, we ask for the street address to make it easy for the buyer to know where the item is located.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Remember</span> you can only add the street of your address or the city of the State. The number of your house is not mandatory.</p>
