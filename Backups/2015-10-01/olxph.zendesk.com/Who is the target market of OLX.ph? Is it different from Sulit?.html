<h1>Who is the target market of OLX.ph? Is it different from Sulit?</h1>
<p><strong>OLX is Sulit, Sulit is OLX</strong>. As long as you have a <strong>2nd hand item</strong> in good condition that you&rsquo;re no longer using, OLX.ph is for you.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, there is not yet much of a tradition of selling your used stuff and most of us end up with cluttered houses full of stuff we don&rsquo;t use. We are so used to holding onto our things that we don&rsquo;t even see them in our houses and in our closets. We want to enable Filipinos to turn that used stuff into real value (i.e. cash) and use it to buy things that they want and need.</p>
<p>On OLX, we believe in helping Filipinos improve their lives and upgrade their stuff by selling their unused items and getting great deals on items they want and need. We believe that everyone has something no longer in use that they can sell.&nbsp; They can and should sell it.&nbsp; <strong>Plus, selling is free!</strong></p>
<p>While everyone has something to sell, we really want to get the message across to people who could use the extra money and free up wasted space such as mothers, students, young professionals, and even retirees.</p>
