<h1>Excessive/Inaccurate OLX Gold Credits Deduction</h1>
<p>We apologize for the technical setbacks that OLX is currently experiencing. As we are working to improve things on our side, we encourage you to check your account's <a href="http://olx.ph/myaccount/paymentconfirmation/">Payment Confirmation</a> page and see if there are any multiple OLX Gold Credit deductions for any Value Added Service (features/feature packages) and Paid Ad slots you purchased. Should there be any, please send us an email at support@olx.ph with the following below, and we'll sort it out for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your OLX account's mobile number</li>
<li>The feature or package (VAS) you applied that was deducted multiple times</li>
<li>A screenshot of your Payment Confirmation showing the multiple deductions</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you so much for your time. Rest assured, we are working on resolving these issues as quickly as we can.</p>
