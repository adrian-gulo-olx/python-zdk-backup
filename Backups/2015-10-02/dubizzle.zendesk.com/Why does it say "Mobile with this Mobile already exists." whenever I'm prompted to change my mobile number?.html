<h1>Why does it say "Mobile with this Mobile already exists." whenever I'm prompted to change my mobile number?</h1>
<p>This message only displays when the mobile number you are attempting to create an account with already has an existing account with dubizzle.com. If you have created this account a long time ago and do not remember the password, you may click on the "forgot password" link on the log in page to have a password reset link sent to your email.<br /><br />If you are certain that you have never created an account with dubizzle before using this mobile number, it is possible that someone had the same mobile number before you and used it to create a dubizzle account. If you feel that this may be the case, please contact us by visiting <a href="http://dubai.dubizzle.com/contact/">http://dubai.dubizzle.com/contact/</a></p>
