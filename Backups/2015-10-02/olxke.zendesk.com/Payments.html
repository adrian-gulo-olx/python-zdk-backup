<h1>Payments</h1>
<p>Always meet the seller in person and transfer cash only when you are sure that the product is in conformity with the description placed in the announcement. Never transfer money in advance and do not pay by account!</p>
<p>OLX does not provide any mechanisms for payment and does not protect payments made by users.</p>
<p>Pay attention! You are responsible for the actions taken by you.</p>
<p><strong>Remember!</strong> Never send money to seller account, do not hand over money or dispatch fee for an item. If the seller insists you that he will send item only after you posted the payment on his account - unsubscribe from this ad and look at the other sellers.</p>
