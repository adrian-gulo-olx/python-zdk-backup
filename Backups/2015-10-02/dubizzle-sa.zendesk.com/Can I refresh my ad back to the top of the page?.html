<h1>Can I refresh my ad back to the top of the page?</h1>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">At the moment the answer to that question is no.  There is no way to refresh your ad back to the first page without posting it again.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">The reason we do not have this functionality is because it would very likely be abused as certain users would inevitably spend all day refreshing their ads to ensure they were always on the first page.  The only way one can currently have their ad back on the front page is to place their ad again.  If you do this, however, we ask that you remove your old ads.  Users that are caught continuously posting repetitive ads do have their accounts suspended.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">On a side note, we are constantly upgrading the search capabilities, allowing users to drill down and filter to find exactly what they want.  This will allow users to drill down to just a few specific listings and will continuously make "first page" positioning less important.</span></p>
