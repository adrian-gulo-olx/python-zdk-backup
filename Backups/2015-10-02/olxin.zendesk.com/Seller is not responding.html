<h1>Seller is not responding</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication between buyer and seller is completely seller’s or buyer’s decision. OLX has no role whatsoever in the messages or conversation happening between buyers and seller’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OLX does not participate in any negotiations between buyers and sellers. Transactions are carried out directly between parties, so we cannot recommend any sellers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For your safety, we always recommend that you analyze the ad of the product you are interested in.  For example, what is the product description, does the telephone number provided correspond to the right company, and does the seller offer payment methods that guarantee the receipt of the product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interested in ads related to property rental, we recommend that you visit the property and speak with other residents before making the corresponding payment. If the ad was posted by a real estate agency, verify that it is a registered agency.</span></p>
<p>Buyer and seller interactions and negotiations are the responsibility of the parties involved.  It is the responsibility of the seller and the buyer to determine how and where the item will be exchanged. The payment method is also up to the seller and buyer to negotiate.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do recommend that you sell to a local buyer so that you can meet the individual in person.  We also recommend choosing a safe place for exchanging your item.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The safety and security of our users is our top priority so please take a look at this <a href="http://olx.in/safetytips/" target="_blank">Safety Tips</a></span></p>
