<h1>My ad was rejected</h1>
<p><a href="http://olx.in/" target="_blank">OLX.in</a> very rarely removes ads. This occurs only in exceptional cases such as breach by user on <a href="http://olx.in/terms/" target="_blank">Rules of Procedure</a> or legislation and notification of rule violations by other users.</p>
<p>Before adding ads make sure that it complies with the applicable rules. You can check <a href="http://olx.in/terms/#r10" target="_blank">here</a>. If your offer is deleted you will receive a message stating the reason for it.</p>
<p>In the case of certain breaches, we send a link to a form to edit the ad that is already mostly filled with content from the deleted(moderated) ads â€“ just improve the invalid parameters and add the offer again.</p>
<p><strong>Please Note!</strong> Repeated violation of the service may result in account block.</p>
