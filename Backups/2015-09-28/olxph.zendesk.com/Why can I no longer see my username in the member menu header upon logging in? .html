<h1>Why can I no longer see my username in the member menu header upon logging in? </h1>
<p>We’ve made things simpler for logged in users. Instead of showing your OLX username, we’re showing the name the you used in creating your email address e.g. <span class="wysiwyg-color-blue"><strong>yourname</strong></span>@domain.com (If you registered with an email address)</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you registered using only your mobile number, you will see your mobile number in the member menu header.</p>
