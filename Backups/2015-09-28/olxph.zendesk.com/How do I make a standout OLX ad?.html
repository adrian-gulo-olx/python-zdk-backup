<h1>How do I make a standout OLX ad?</h1>

<p>Everyone likes to haggle, so ads that have negotiable prices are those that usually get the most buyer inquiries. But this is up to you. The idea is that the price posted for your item is fair and within the average price range. Don’t just put P1.00 since it wouldn't be fair to your buyers, plus it will not pass our screen test! You may refer to other OLX ads to get an idea of how much same/similar items are priced.</p>

<p>It is much more enticing to buy an item if the photo gives a good idea of how it looks. We allow up to 12 photos but 3-5 photos is ideal. What’s important is that they are CLEAR and ACTUAL photos of the item. Please do not use stock photos online. It is better to capture the item from several angles, and include all dents and scratches, if any.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we recommend using a business/company logo as your ads' primary photo if you're posting in categories such as Services, Jobs, or Business and Earning Opportunities. Alternatively, you may also use plaint text photos generally indicating what your ad is all about.</p>

<p>This is what your buyers will see first, so it's better if it’s a detailed overview of your item. For example, “iPhone 6 32GB Factory Unlocked”–this already gives your buyers an idea of what they're in for.</p>
