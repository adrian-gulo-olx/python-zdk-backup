<h1>How does the Sponsored Ad bidding works?</h1>
<p>User must purchase a bid and set the duration or the number of days it will appear as a sponsored ad.</p>
<p>The higher the bid a user purchased, the higher the frequency that his ad will appear in the Sponsored Ad boxes. Regardless of how small or big the purchased bid is, the userâ€™s ad will still appear in the Sponsored Ad box. Smaller bids will have lower frequencies and higher purchased bids will have higher frequencies.</p>
