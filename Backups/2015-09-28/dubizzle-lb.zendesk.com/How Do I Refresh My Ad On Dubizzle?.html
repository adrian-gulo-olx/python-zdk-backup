<h1>How Do I Refresh My Ad On Dubizzle?</h1>
<p>Right now, there is no facility to refresh your ad on dubizzle.<br /><br />If you wish to push your ad back to the top of the page, you need to re-post it. If you chose to do this, we just ask that you delete the old ad to prevent duplicates.<br />Duplicate ad listing can lead to account suspension.</p>
